Yoga Pose Estimation using YOLOv8
Overview
This project aims to implement a Yoga Pose Estimation system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The YOLOv8 version introduces significant improvements in performance and accuracy. This project specifically focuses on detecting and estimating various yoga poses from input images or video streams.

Features
Real-time detection of multiple yoga poses.
High accuracy and speed with YOLOv8.
Easy-to-use interface for both images and video inputs.
Detailed pose information and visualizations.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but recommended for real-time performance)
The following Python packages:
numpy
opencv-python
torch
torchvision
ultralytics (for YOLOv8)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yoga-pose-estimation-yolov8.git
cd yoga-pose-estimation-yolov8
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
For this project, you can use a pre-existing dataset of yoga poses or create your own. Ensure the dataset is labeled correctly in a format supported by YOLOv8.

Usage
Prepare the dataset:

Organize your dataset into a structure that YOLOv8 expects, typically with images and corresponding annotation files.
Update the configuration file (data.yaml) with the path to your dataset.
Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data data.yaml --weights yolov8s.pt
Test the model:

bash
Copy code
python test.py --data data.yaml --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640
Run inference on images:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --source path/to/your/image.jpg --img 640
Run inference on video:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --source path/to/your/video.mp4 --img 640
Results
After running inference, the results will be saved in the runs/detect/exp directory. This will include annotated images or videos showcasing the detected yoga poses.

Customization
Model Configuration:
Modify the yolov8.yaml configuration file to change the model architecture or hyperparameters.

Data Augmentation:
Enhance your dataset with various augmentation techniques to improve model robustness. This can be configured in the training script.

Troubleshooting
CUDA Errors:
Ensure your CUDA drivers and PyTorch installation match. Refer to the PyTorch installation guide for troubleshooting GPU-related issues.

Model Accuracy:
If the model's accuracy is not satisfactory, consider the following:

Increasing the size of your dataset.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Experimenting with different YOLOv8 versions or custom architectures.
